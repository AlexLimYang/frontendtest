# React, Redux, and Material-UI for bootstrapping a Dapp

In addition to Webpack and React, this box adds: React-Router, Redux and Material-UI for easy skinning of a Dapp.


## Installation

1. Install npm packages.
    ```javascript
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the webpack server for front-end hot reloading. For now, smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    npm start
    ```
